Here, I have used Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set (obtained from Kaggle and added to this repository). In this, I explored a classification problem, performed dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis and some classification algorithms, tried to improve these classifiers using hyperparameter tuning and in the end built an ensemble model to get a high accuracy score along with high precision and recall.
